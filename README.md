# No Smoke Simplified

### No Smoke for fires, hearths, braziers and smelters... That's it

Word of warning. I have no plans to add features unless it follows in the general direction of this mod.

- Stop the smoke for fires, hearths and braziers
- Stop the smoke and stack those smelters

### About the Mod:
This mod is not compatible with NoSmokeStayLit.  The mod will fail to load.

I created this mod because my NoSmokeStayLit mod is a victim of feature creep.  This goes back to the original idea of 
simply removing smoke for building or game performance.



### Credits:

- Aedenthorn because without their code repository, I would have never understood how to do any of this.
- Azumatt for help with the braziers


### Configuration:

The config file is located in "<GameDirectory>\Bepinex\config" (You need to start the game at least once, with the mod installed to create the config file).
